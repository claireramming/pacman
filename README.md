# Pacman in Javascript

Built from scratch in Javacsript with barebones code from Scrimba tutorial made by Ania Kubow. 

Images were not made by me. 

### Current functionality past Ania's course:
- pacman moves on it's own until it hits a wall
- extra styling
- pacman 'eats' and changes visually direction
- cherry placed randomly in empty square after certain point

### known bugs:
- pacman does not always eat ghost when it should

### upcoming functionality
- support for multiple levels
- new board display
- logic for ghosts to chase pacman and "run from" pacman if scared
- option to restart game without reloading
- will visually show a win or loss (other than game functions stopping)
